    <div class="message">
      <p>From the bottom of my heart, I wish the happiest birthday to the most beautiful soul Iâ€™ve ever known â€” you, Ishita.</p>
      <p>Every moment with you feels like a gift, and today is the day the world was blessed with your presence â€” 08.08.2008 â€” a magical date for a magical girl.</p>
      <p>As you step into your 17th year, I just want you to know how proud I am of the incredible person you are becoming. You are kind, strong, and full of dreams.</p>
      <p>I know that one day you'll wear that white coat with pride and become the doctor youâ€™ve always dreamed of. And when that day comes, remember â€” Iâ€™ll still be here, cheering you on, holding your hand through every step, through every challenge.</p>
      <p>Ishita, I may not have the most perfect words, but my feelings for you are true, deep, and endless. Youâ€™re not just the girl I love â€” youâ€™re my hope, my peace, and my reason to believe in a better tomorrow.</p>
      <p>May this year bring you closer to your dreams, fill your heart with joy, and remind you always â€” that you are never alone. Iâ€™m with you. Always.</p>
      <p class="final-line">Happy Birthday, my little doctor. <br> Forever yours, <br> <b>A...</b> ðŸ’Œ</p>
